# General description
Become one of the first users in this game, where you can train your skills in fitness in order to defeat dungeons and traverse dangerous regions. Party up with your gang to defeat the dungeons easier!! Defeating dungeons allow you to gain superb loot, which can be used to boost your stats. However, not all items are available for everyone. That is why, you can trade with other players!!! Complete your daily quests to be more fit and strong!!! 


# Flow:
- Choose to become one of the classes: Warrior, Archer, Mage, Assassin.
- Direct to the profile page, where you can view your stats and inventory. Also, there are daily quests for you to manage your fitness.
- Go to challenges, to view all the fitness challenges you can perform to gain muscles and speed!
- With more skillpoints gained from these challenges, you level up. Keep in mind though, the levelling only gets harder as you progress.
- Go to regions, where you can view all the available regions that you can travel to. Though, there are tough level requirements that you have to meet in order to travel. Inside a party? Travelling together. Inside a trade? No travelling.
- Inside regions where there are dungeons, you can fight the dungeons in order to gain loot. Keep in mind though, these dungeons are not easy!!!
- You may have noticed the first region doesn't have a dungeon. Thats because that's where users spawn!! However, you can trade inside that region, so thats a plus.
- Fight harder dungeons in order to gain better chances of higher tier loot!!
- As mentioned before, you can only equip items of your class. For example, an archer cannot equip a dagger, which is made for an assassin :sad face:
- Don't be disappointed when you get this loot though, because guess what? You can trade this item for another item suitable for your class!!!
- Don't forget to check out the profiles of your friends and other users!!!

- Last but not least, leave a review after every challenges has been completed!!!
- Create your own challenges too !!!
